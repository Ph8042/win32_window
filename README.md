# How to build
1. **Set up your environment**:
    - Ensure you have **Visual Studio** installed with the **C++ Build Tools**.
    - Make sure the **CL compiler** (`cl.exe`) is available in your system's **PATH**. This should be set up when you install Visual Studio or you can manually add the path to `cl.exe`.
2.  **Clone the repository**: If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine:
```
https://github.com/Ph8042/win32_window.git
```
3. **Run the build script**: Inside the repository directory, youâ€™ll find a `build.bat` script. To build the application, simply run the script by executing:
```
build.bat
```
